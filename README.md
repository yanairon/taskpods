`taskpods` is a lightweight CLI that lets you spin up disposable **AI pods** inside your Git repo.  
Each pod is an isolated Git worktree/branch ‚Äî perfect for experimenting with Copilot, Cursor, or Claude Code without polluting `main`.  
When done, you can merge, PR, or nuke the pod entirely.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Instant sandbox:** `taskpods start <name>` ‚Üí creates `.taskpods/<name>` and `pods/<name>` from `main`.  
- **Clean exit:** `taskpods done <name>` ‚Üí commit, push, open a PR (via [`gh` CLI]), then remove the worktree.  
- **Abort button:** `taskpods abort <name>` ‚Üí deletes an unpushed pod safely.  
- **Status overview:** `taskpods list` ‚Üí see all active pods and paths.  
- **Housekeeping:** `taskpods prune` ‚Üí removes pods already merged upstream.

## ü§î Why worktrees?

Git worktrees let you check out multiple branches in separate dirs without cloning. They‚Äôre fast, disk-light, and easy to clean up.  
`taskpods` wraps the common `git worktree` operations with sensible defaults and quality-of-life features like PR creation and safe aborts.
